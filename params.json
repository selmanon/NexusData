{"name":"Nexusdata","tagline":"Core Data for Android","body":"NexusData\r\n=========\r\n**Core Data for Android**\r\n\r\nNexusData is an object graph and persistence framework for Android. It allows for organizing and managing relational\r\ndata and serializing it to SQLite or custom stores. The data can be accessed or modified using higher level objects\r\nrepresenting entities and their relationships. NexusData manages all the objects in the persistence store, tracks\r\nchanges, and maintains consistency in relationships.\r\n\r\nEssentially, it brings Core Data functionality from iOS to Android. However, the library is not intended to be a\r\nstraight port of Core Data. Instead, it aims to leverage Core Data's concepts, while having the flexibility to evolve\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\nNexusData is not an ORM in that it's more higher-level and is not tied to a specific storage engine. The query interface\r\nis oblivious to the underlying persistence store.\r\n\r\nNexusData supports Android API 10+. This library follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Note that this\r\nlibrary is still active in development, and is missing a lot of features. New releases might introduce\r\ninterface-breaking changes, which will be indicated in the changelog. NexusData 1.0.0 will be the first stable release.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit the project's page at: http://github.com/dkharrat/NexusData\r\n","google":"UA-46124835-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
